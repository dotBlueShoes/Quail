%unityPath 			= C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\6000.0.34f1\Editor\Unity.exe

# COMMANDS
#

# Open a "Unity" project using specified version of "Unity" - Executable. 
!open 				= start "" "%unityPath%" -projectPath "%unityProject%"

#  !Important
# Be aware this is prob. not the best way to do this. I would 
#  recommend running a separate batch program for this. Simply
#  to control the execution time. The following command runs on 
#  a separate process.

# Build a "Unity" project using a specified platform. 
!build 				= start "" "%unityPath%" -quit -batchmode -projectpath "%unityProject%" -buildWindows64Player "%buildDestination%"
